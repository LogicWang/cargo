# cargo - pure c code practice
without any package build tool, just for practice
each package in src is independent.
you can compile each single package and run it.
read package details by their own readme doc.
if you want to run any single program
- step1. checkout code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/logic-pw/cargo.git 
```
- step2. switch to corresponding dir
for example
```bash
cd ./src/kr/
```
- step3. compile with command
```bash
gcc -o myapp.out xxx.c  
```

- step4. run compiled program
```bash
./ myapp.out
```
